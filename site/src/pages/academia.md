    abstract = {In recent years, digital twins have been pervading different application domains—from manufacturing to healthcare—as an approach for virtualising different kinds of physical entities (things, products, machines). The dominant view developed in the literature so far is about the virtualisation of individual physical assets in a closed-system perspective. In this article, we introduce and explore a broader perspective that we call Web of Digital Twins (WoDT), in which the digital twin paradigm is exploited for the pervasive softwarisation of possibly large-scale interrelated physical realities. A WoDT can be conceived as an open, distributed and dynamic ecosystem of connected digital twins, functioning as an interoperable service-oriented layer for applications running on top, especially smart applications and multiagent systems. The article introduces an abstract model and architecture aimed to capture key aspects of the idea not bound to any specific application domains or implementing technologies and discusses their adoption in engineering real-world systems. To this purpose, two concrete case studies are considered, in the context of healthcare and smart mobility. Finally, the article includes a discussion of a selected set of research directions.},

### :page_facing_up: Engineering Interoperable Ecosystems of Digital Twins: A Web-based Approach
**Authors**: *Andrea Giulianelli, Samuele Burattini, Andrei Ciortea, Alessandro Ricci* \
**Link**: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3652620.3688263

This is the paper that propose a **hypermedia-based** implementation of the *Web of Digital Twins* to provide interoperability in Digital Twin ecosystems. \
Therefore, this is the paper to cite for the **HWoDT Framework**.

    abstract = {Digital Twins have been primarily developed and used to virtualize individual standalone physical assets, resulting in vertical application stacks. Going beyond this perspective, recent proposals envision ecosystems of connected digital twins that virtualize complex realities composed of a multitude of heterogeneous but interrelated physical assets --- possibly belonging to different domains. This vision puts forth a number of engineering challenges, at the center of which is the capability of integrating digital twins developed with heterogeneous technologies. To this end, in this paper, we propose and discuss an approach based on Web standards and technologies for creating interoperable ecosystems of digital twins that applications can access and exploit as a service while being agnostic to the underlying heterogeneous technologies.},
